A process executing in a less-privileged mode often needs to call a procedure that executes in a more-privileged mode; for example, a user program requires an operating system service.

"In a queueing system, new jobs must wait for a while before being served. While a job waits, its priority increases linearly with time from zero at a rate a. A job waits until its priority reaches the priority of the jobs in service; then, it begins to share the processor equally with other jobs in service using round robin while its priority continues to increase at a slower rate b. The algorithm is referred to as selfish round robin, because the jobs in service try (in vain) to monopolize the processor by increasing their priority continuously. Use Figure 9.19 to show that the mean response time Rx for a job of service time x is given by: where Rx s +x-s 1 - r 1 - r r ls r assuming that arrival and service times are exponentially distributed with means 1/ and s, respectively.

A process executing in a less-privileged mode often needs to call a procedure that executes in a more-privileged mode; for example, a user program requires an operating system service.

Consider the case in which a program calls a C subroutine that allocates a local array on the stack that consumes 10 K. The kernel will expand the stack segment to accommodate it. When the subroutine returns, the stack pointer is adjusted and this space could be released by the kernel, but it is not released. Explain why it would be possible to shrink the stack at this point and why the UNIX kernel does not shrink it.",analyze

"In a queueing system, new jobs must wait for a while before being served. While a job waits, its priority increases linearly with time from zero at a rate a. A job waits until its priority reaches the priority of the jobs in service; then, it begins to share the processor equally with other jobs in service using round robin while its priority continues to increase at a slower rate b. The algorithm is referred to as selfish round robin, because the jobs in service try (in vain) to monopolize the processor by increasing their priority continuously. Use Figure 9.19 to show that the mean response time Rx for a job of service time x is given by: where Rx s +x-s 1 - r 1 - r r ls r assuming that arrival and service times are exponentially distributed with means 1/ and s, respectively.
